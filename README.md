# Responsive Gift Shop Website Template

This is a modern, modular, responsive gift shop website template for e-commerce built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I didn’t use any CSS or JavaScript frameworks and built it with CSS techniques, such as flexbox and grid system.

The gift shop template has been tested on the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Opera browsers (September 2021) and has passed all tests successfully. These tests included responsiveness to show the effectiveness of the template not only on desktop computers, but also on tablets and smartphones.

I used [Normalize](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css) to make the template consistent so that it looks the same across browsers. [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com) used for the icons and [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) used as the font family. All images are free to use and most of them are from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com). Thanks to [Amys Xain](https://disqus.com/by/amysxain) for the Photoshop design of the template.
